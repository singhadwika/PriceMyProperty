# PriceMyProperty

PriceMyProperty is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the final sale price of a house using various features from the Ames, Iowa housing dataset.

- `train.csv`: Training set with 1460 rows (houses) and 80 columns (features).
- `test.csv`: Testing set with 1461 rows (houses) and 79 columns (features, excluding the target price).
